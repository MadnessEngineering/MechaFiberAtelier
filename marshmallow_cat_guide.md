## Page 5: Assembly Instructions

### Assembly Order
1. **Head to Body:** Position head on the front-top of the marshmallow body, slightly forward of center. The head should sit naturally without tilting backward.

2. **Ears:** Fold each ear slightly and sew to the top sides of the head, spacing them evenly.

3. **Front Legs:** Position front legs on the lower front of the body, slightly angled forward. They should look like the cat is sitting upright.

4. **Back Legs:** Attach back legs to the lower back sides of the body, angled slightly outward for stability.

5. **Tail:** Sew tail to the back center of the body, positioned to curve around the side when laid flat.

### Sewing Tips
- Use a whip stitch or mattress stitch for strong, invisible seams
- Pin parts in place before sewing if needed
- Stuff any gaps that appear during assembly
- Double-stitch attachment points for durability

### Optional Details
- **Cheek Blush:** Light pink yarn in small circular pattern on cheeks

### Final Finishing
1. Weave in all loose ends securely

## Page 7: Troubleshooting & Variations

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Problem:** Body isn't round enough
**Solution:** Add more stuffing and ensure increases/decreases are evenly distributed

**Problem:** Head tilts backward
**Solution:** Reposition attachment point more forward on the body

**Problem:** Legs don't sit properly
**Solution:** Adjust angle of attachment and ensure body is well-stuffed for stability

**Problem:** Marshmallow body looks flat
**Solution:** Add more fiberfill to the middle section, it should be very puffy

### Size Variations
- **Mini Version:** Use sport weight yarn with E/4 hook
- **Giant Version:** Use chunky yarn with K/10.5 hook and double the rounds
- **Skinny Version:** Reduce middle section rounds to 6-8 instead of 12

### Color Variations
- **Calico Cat:** Use multiple colors in patches
- **Striped Cat:** Change colors every few rounds
- **Realistic Colors:** Use appropriate cat colors (orange, gray, brown, etc.)

### Care Instructions
- Hand wash in cool water with mild detergent
- Air dry completely before storing
- Brush gently with soft brush to restore texture if needed

## Page 8: Pattern Notes & Credits

### Design Notes
This marshmallow cat pattern emphasizes the soft, squishy texture that makes it perfect for cuddling. The oversized body compared to the head and limbs creates the "marshmallow" effect, while the construction method ensures the cat can sit upright or lay on its side naturally.

### Skill Building
This pattern helps develop:
- Consistent tension control
- 3D shaping techniques
- Assembly and finishing skills
- Color work (if using variations)

### Yarn Substitutions
Any worsted weight yarn works well for this pattern. Consider:
- **Cotton:** More structured, holds shape well
- **Acrylic:** Soft, machine washable, budget-friendly  
- **Wool:** Natural, warm feel but requires careful washing
